## TextMate bundles
This extension uses Visual Studio's capability to load TextMate bundles.

It works by registering TextMate bundles so that Visual Studio will
automatically load them when a file is opened that matches one of the
bundles and no other language service is available for the specific
file type.

For instance, this extension contains a TextMate bundle for YAML files,
but if you decide to install the more powerful
[YAML Editor extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/34423c06-f756-4721-8394-bc3d23b91ca7)
then that extension will win. That makes it safe to install this
extension even if you have separate extensions for one or more of the
languages already.

## Unsupported langauges
The Textmate bundle support in Visual Studio 2015/2017 doesn't support all languages. Here are some extensions that provide language support to some of these unsupported languages:

- **PHP** - [PHP Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6eb51f05-ef01-4513-ac83-4c5f50c95fb5).
- **T4 (.tt)** - [Tangible T4 Editor](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/784cf592-b797-4d4d-ad33-331fcf63faad)

Also please note that Textmate bundles for JavaScript and TypeScript are not working correctly and it is recommended to install the native VS components for those languages.

## Known issues
You need [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs) or newer for the Textmate bundles to work correctly. 

## File Icons
For the best experience, it is recommended that you also install the
free 
[File Icons extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5e1762e8-a88b-417c-8467-6a65d771cc4e).

## Contribute
Feel free to suggest new languages not currently supported by this
extension on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/madskristensen/TextmateBundleInstaller/issues).
If you know a TextMate bundle that would work, then remember to add a
link to that as well.
